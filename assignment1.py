# 1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be
# integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.

# In[ ]:


* - expressions

-87.8-value
- -expression
(-, value)
+ - expression
6 - value


# 2. What is the difference between string and variable?

# In[ ]:


A variable can be of several types like integer, string, float, etc. 
based on the value you assign to it.
anything you assign to a variable using quotes (single or double) will be considered as a string.

Eg, numA = 23(variable) 
    A = (“dhoni”) (string)


# 3. Describe three different data types.

# In[ ]:


Ans. int - A positive or negative whole number without a decimal point( a = 50)
floating point- A number witha decimal point.(b=22.5)
string - any text with in two single or double quotes.(c=“bikash”)


# 4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?

# In[ ]:


ans-Expression is made up of values, containers, and mathematical operators.
Eg, a = 3+4 and expressions are used to evaluate the value.


# 5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an
# expression and a statement?

# In[ ]:


Ans. The assignemnt statemets assign a value to the variable.
in spam = 10 , value 10 in assigned to spam, and now spam will have value 10.
But in expression a = C+B, the value of a depends on the value of C and B.


# 6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
# bacon = 22
# bacon + 1

# In[ ]:


Sol: it gives 23 as execution code 


# 7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
# spam' + 'spamspam'('spamspamspam')
# 'spam' * 3('spamspamspam') 

# In[ ]:


sol: it will be the same 


# 8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?

# In[ ]:


ans-Variable name can not starts with numbers.
Eg.a100 is valid


# 9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string
# version of a value?

# In[ ]:


ans: str(), int(), float()


# 10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
# 'I have eaten' + 99 + 'burritos' 

# In[ ]:


Ans. 99 is an integer it cannot be concatenated with strings, if we have to 
concatenate This can be fixed by converting 99 into string by str(99)
